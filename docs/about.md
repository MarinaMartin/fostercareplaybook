The Child Welfare Playbook is a collection of creative practices that lead to tangible improvements and efficiencies in support of foster children and families. Our goal is to create a public, actionable playbook documenting proven best practices that can be easily replicated and scaled by others.

The Playbook is the result of a collaboration between states at the cutting edge of this work and [New America's Public Interest Technology team](https://www.newamerica.org/public-interest-technology/), in partnership with the [Beeck Center’s Digital Service Collaborative (DSC)](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/project/digital-service-collaborative-building-capacity-for-digital-transformation-in-government/), [Foster America](https://www.foster-america.org/), and [Think of Us](https://www.thinkof-us.org/).

### Membership

Any state, county (in county-administered systems), or private agency is welcome to join us. We also welcome input from any individuals or organizations with expertise and best practices to share!

Our current members include: California, Indiana, Maryland (State of Maryland, along with Baltimore, Frederick, Montgomery, and Prince George’s counties), Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Virginia (Fairfax county), Washington DC, and Washington State.

**There is absolutely no cost to participate, and the commitment is just two hours a month.**

To join, email marina AT marinanitze DOT com.

In exchange for participating, members gain:
* Best practices for improving their processes, in an actionable format (e.g. sample contracts, checklists, policy language, etc.)
* Data about how current practices compare with other states (shared in a private, respectful manner - no shaming/ranking)
* Opportunities to participate in cross-state improvement projects
* Positive media coverage related to participation (always cleared/approved ahead of time)
* Implementation assistance for adapting best practices

How it works:
* Every month, we focus on a specific topic area (e.g. home inspections, foster parent training, increasing kin licensing). 
We will schedule a one-hour "interview" with your subject matter expert(s) for the topic to gather information.
* Everyone joins a one-hour webinar where we share key findings and best practices from existing pilots and national experts, and suggest cross-state projects.
* You will receive a personalized follow-up with recommendations for your specific processes.
* Optionally, we can also hold a 1:1 follow-up call to go over more in-depth recommendations for your team, and to provide any implementation help you may need.
* Best practices and positive results will be captured here in the online Foster Care Playbook, including actionable collateral like example checklists and contracts.
