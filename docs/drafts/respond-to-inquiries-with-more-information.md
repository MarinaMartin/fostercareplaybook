### The Problem It Solves

When someone fills out a foster parent inquiry form, they might be ready to go right away, or they might need time to think about making such a significant commitmnet. Following up quickly with more information gives primed aplicants a way to get started and make a more informed choice about whether fostering is right for them; including options for supporting foster children in other ways can help more hesitant families get (and stay) engaged.

### How To Do This

* Set up an autoreponsder email with brief links to information on fostering. Consider adding in tips for ways to support foster youth without becoming a foster parent, to expand options.

* Provide a printed version of this email for families who do not use email.

* Create a regular newsletter (email and/or print) to keep interested families engaged.

* Avoid high-pressure tactics. Some great caregivers can take years to be ready to apply to be a foster parent after they first submit an inquiry.
