### The Play

Focus some recruitment efforts on existing kinship caregivers. Make sure case workers discuss the idea of becoming a general licensed home with kinship caregivers at regular touchpoints, and especially at permamency milestones such as return home. Your system should have a clear, documented path for "converting" from a kinship caregiver to a general licensed home without having to start from scratch.

Not every relative caregiver may be a good match for, or even interested in, taking in children they do not know. But even converting a small percentage of relative caregivers to open their homes to more children can make a big difference in

### The Problem It Solves

Every child welfare system is looking for more families. Kinship caregivers are often already fully licensed (or may have only minor steps remaining to become fully licensed), are familiar with the system, and may have fewer negative preconceived beliefs about foster children.

### How To Do This

* Formally note when a relative caregiver has capacity for additional children in their home (even if they currently only have a child-specific license).
* Encourage case workers to discuss the possibility of becoming a general foster home with kinship caregivers, especially after milestones like a return home.
* When a placement search reveals no matching general caregivers, look if there are matching kinship caregivers. 
* If your system prevents searching across both kinds of caregivers, consider reimagining this when it's time to redo your CCWIS placements module.


### Who's Doing This?

* In Colorado, the [Kin Connect Child Placing Agency](https://kinconnect.org/) specializes in helping kinship caregivers become licensed, and encourages them to consider general licensed care.
* In Washington, DC case workers track kinship caregivers' capacity and milestones on a monthly basis. If they see a kinship caregiver may have extra capacity, or after a kinship placement returns home (or achieves permanency with them), they initiate conversations about becoming a general foster home instead of closing.
* In Washington State, kinship caregivers who are well-supported and have extra capacity are asked to add a "plus one" to their license to leave open the possibility of taking another child.
* In Indiana, case workers are encouraged to discuss the possibility of taking on additional foster placements with kinship caregivers on an individual basis.
