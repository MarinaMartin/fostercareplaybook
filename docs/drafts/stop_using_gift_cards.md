### The Play

Give cash or prepaid cards for stipends instead of store-specific gift cards like Target cards.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone responsible for distributing stipends to youth<br />
**Cost:**
Free<br />
**Timeframe:**
Immediate<br />
**Difficulty:**
Easy<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Older youth often rely on their stipends to cover food and basic necessities. They cannot buy as much food for $20 at Target as they can at a grocery store. 

In a multi-state discovery sprint with older foster youth, [Think of Us](https://www.thinkof-us.org) found that when youth receive Target gift cards, they often engage in a complicated workaround: they purchase miscellaneous Target items, then return them in batches to receive cash refunds in increments of $10. They then used that cash to buy food at other stores.

### How To Do This

In order of preference:
* Give youth cash
* Deposit stipends in a youth’s bank account immediately
* Send payment with a cash app of the youth’s choosing (e.g. [Cashapp](https://cash.app/), [Venmo](https://venmo.com/about/product/))
* Give youth a prepaid cash card such as a [Visa gift card](https://usa.visa.com/pay-with-visa/find-card/get-prepaid-card) (ensure it has no transaction fees)
* Discuss with youth the type of gift card they would prefer, and provide that


### Outcomes Data

Youth will be able to afford more food and essentials with the same stipend amount.
