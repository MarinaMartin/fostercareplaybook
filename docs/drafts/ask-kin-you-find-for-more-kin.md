### The Play

When you connect with a youth's kin, make it a point to always ask them if they know of other potential kin, whether they may be current connections to the child or family members that they haven't yet met.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone<br />

**Timeframe:**
Immediate<br />
**Difficulty:**
Easy<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Children can't have too many adults who care about them. Most youth enter foster care with more connections than they leave with. Making sure to ask kin you know about to help identify additional kin, especially if children are too young to share on their own, can create a broader supportive network.

### How To Do This

* Make it a standard practice to ask kin about other kin during initial, and ongoing, kin contacts
* Add a question like "Are there other connections that we should know about?" to any kinship-finding form letters or standard messages.
* Ask supportive adults who attend planning meetings if there are others who should be in attendance.

* Michigan explicitly asks identified kin to share the names of more kin on their (Relative Notification Form)[http://www.michigan.gov/documents/dhs/DHS-0990_265835_7.dot]
