title: Don't license homes that are only interested in adopting infants
description: Foster care is not an adoption agency. Homes that are only interested in adopting infants take up valuable resources and are not aligned with reunification goals.

### The Play

Focus your resources on resource families who can support reunification goals, and not on licensing families who are only willing to take legally-free infants. This wastes scarce state resources and also sets false expectations for these families, as foster care is not an adoption agency and they are highly unlikely to ever receive a call.

### The Problem It Solves

At a glance, many states have literally hundreds of "open" foster home beds that are not open at all, because they are only willing to accept legally-free infants. These homes require resources to license and maintain, when foster care systems do not lack options for legally-free young children. 

### How To Do This

* Require licenses be for wider age ranges (e.g. 0-12) than just 0-2. In some states, this is a policy change; in others, a legislative change may be necessary.
* Use reunification-friendly language in your recruitment materials, and focus adoption materials on youth who actually need adoptive homes (e.g. sibling groups and older youth).
* Confirm there is a clear plan for redirecting families who are only interested in infant adoption, or you risk eventually licensing them without realizing it.

### Who's Doing This?

* Oklahoma started the Resource Family Model in 2018, which emphasizes the need for reunification. It does not approve caregivers (kinship caregivers aside) who are only willing to take placements under age 12.
* Ohio counties can redirect families only interested in ages 0 to 3 to private adoption agencies as long as this is written in their recruitment plan. Ohio also has a rule allowing them to close homes if a family declines to take a placement over a certain period of time.
