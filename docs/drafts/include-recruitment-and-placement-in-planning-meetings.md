### The Problem It Solves

Recruiters can do their best work if they understand the current characteristics of families that children in care need most. Without this context, they may recruit families who do not match the needs of children in care.

### How To Do This

* Hold monthly meetings to review children who do not have placements or who have non-ideal placements (e.g. placed far away from their family of origin). Include case workers, placement workers, and recruiters. (Ideally, include private agency representatives too!)
* Include placement and recruitment team members in regular planning meetings.
* Provide ways for placement workers to communicate with a child's worker to ask questions and learn more about their needs.


### Who's Doing This?

* In Frederick County, Maryland, case workers and placement workers sit side by side. This creates an environment of collaboration where all team members can work together to recruit or match children to families that can best meet their needs.
* Hawaii holds monthly calls to review its list of children needing placement. It includes case workers, shelter representatives, administrators, and recruiters.
* Washington DC meets every other week with placement and recruitment to discuss and plan for emerging needs and trends.
