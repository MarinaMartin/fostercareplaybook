### The Play

Update recruitment materials, messaging, and inquiry forms to reflect the real needs of our foster children: homes that will prioritize helping to reunify and heal their family of origin, or, providing permanency for older youth and sibling groups. Workers should have multiple conversations about potential families' expectations and work to clarify that fostering is not the right choice for a family that is only looking to adopt an infant.

### The Problem It Solves

Many child welfare systems license hundreds of families that are only interested in adopting infants. These homes are not needed, and take up valuable staff and financial resources to license and maintain.

### How To Do This

* If you ask about placement preferences in your inquiry form, remove references to "adoption" or replace them with more accurate language like "adopting teenagers or sibling groups"

* Slides or promotional materials about adoption should reflect the children who need adoptive homes. Remove any photos or references of babies or toddlers.

* Train staff in how to discuss and realign expectations with families about fostering to adopt. (Indiana recommends some helpful videos below.)

* Draft form emails and letters to respond to families who are only interested in adoption, redirecting them to legally-free youth in need of families.


### Who's Doing This?

* Montgomery County, MD's statute says "our purpose is to meet the needs of the kids in our community" and they have no children awaiting adoption. They use this statute to politely decline families just interested in adoption.

* Washington, DC helps set expectations by sharing in orientation that they have not had a legally-free infant available in over a decade, and that the agency is _not_ an adoption agency.

* Indiana focuses its messaging with potential foster families and with staff that their role is to support the reunification of the family of origin. They report [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdTyJUO5Vqw) [videos](https://youtu.be/kiHGxRQPRGE) are helpful in training.

* Fairfax County, VA sends a form letter to families interested in adoption that redirects them to children who are in need of permanent homes, and only pursues approval when a family is interested in adopting a specific, available child.
