### The Play

Reduce the amount of paperwork that licensing workers are responsible for by providing clerical support. Clerical workers are often the unsung heroes of every office!

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone<br />
**Cost:**
FTE<br />
**Timeframe:**
Months<br />
**Difficulty:**
Medium<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Case workers spend a significant amount of time on paperworkâ€”time that they could otherwise spend directly with the families, or on their evaluations.

### How To Do This

* Hire one or more (depending on the size of your office) clerical workers. They can send and receive physical mail and email, keep track of paperwork requirements for each family, track renewal requirements, [send appointment reminders](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/playbook/send_appointment_reminders), track background check paperwork, and handle other clerical responsibilities.
* You may be able to leverage clerical staff in another department, or convert an existing position.

### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but believe that this:
* Increases the time social workers can spend with families
* Increases the likelihood that families are effectively evaluated
