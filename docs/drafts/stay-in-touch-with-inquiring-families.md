### The Problem It Solves

Child welfare systems need more caregivers. By staying engaged with families who have shown an interest, you may be able to convert some into licensed caregivers, while still getting meaningful support from others in the form of donation drives, CASA volunteers, mentors, etc.

### How To Do This

* Create a regular newsletter you send to all families who submit inquiries. It doesn't have to be long or complicated - just a story or a link or two.

* Create [a schedule](/set-ticklers-to-remember-to-check-back-with-inquiries.html) for following back up with inquiring families.

### Who's Doing This?

* Washington DC checks back with everyone who filled out an inquiry form every quarter. Once, a family who had been on their inquiry list for 10 years was ready to start the application process, and they became a licensed caregiver!

* Prince George's County goes back through recent inquiries to re-invite them to upcoming orientations and other events.

* Michigan has an email newsletter that it sends to interested families containing agency news, child spotlights, and ways to get engaged.
