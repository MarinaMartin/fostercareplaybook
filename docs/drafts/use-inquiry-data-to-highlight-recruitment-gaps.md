### The Play

Compare your inquiry data against any data you have about the characteristics of foster homes you need most, e.g., zip codes where children most often experience removal. Focus more recruitment efforts on areas where there are the greatest gaps.

### The Problem It Solves

Child welfare systems have limited recruitment resources. Inquiry data is one input you can use to help focus your recruitment efforts on the communities, and even neighborhoods, where you most need homes yet are receiving the fewest inquiries.

### How To Do This

* Track data in your inquiry form (e.g. caregiver's interests, tribal status, language spoken, or zip code) against the characteristics you most need in foster families. You'll want to prioritize licensing _matching_ families, while also prioritizing recruitment efforts in the communities where you have the biggest gaps in need.


### Who's Doing This?

* Prince George's County, MD tracks the zip codes of new inquiries against the zip codes where they most need placements, and then focuses recruitment efforts on the missing zip code areas.
