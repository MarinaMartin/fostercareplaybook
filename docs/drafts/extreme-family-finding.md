### The Play

Extreme Family Finding leverages a private investigator and an all-hands-on-deck approach to finding a foster child's family. Children who are selected for Extreme Family Finding can enter with as few as no connections, with a goal of creating a [genogram](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/playbook/genogram-tools.html) of at least 125 adults. While the primary goal for family finding is to find a permanent placement, this effort is also crucial for building up an entire supportive network for every youth.

Initial Extreme Family Finding sites were funded by a grant from the Children's Bureau.

### The Problem It Solves

Child welfare systems have limited resources for family finding, and sometimes, family is unwilling to talk to government officials like Department staff. Extreme Family Finding puts a private investigator on the case of finding a child's full family tree, many of whom are much more willing to talk to a detective.

### How To Do This

* Even absent an official grant for Extreme Family Finding, you can recreate parts of the program by:
  * Build extensive [genograms](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/playbook/genogram-tools.html) for every child in care, with the goal of at least 30-80 connections
  * Hire a private investigator to find and talk to family connections for foster youth with few known connections
  * Preserve known connections as soon as children enter care with [heart maps](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/playbook/heart_maps.html) and [plans to stay connected to supportive adults](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/playbook/plan-to-stay-in-touch-with-supportive-connections.html).

* Extreme Family Finding focuses on youth who are most at risk of aging out of care without permanency.


### Who's Doing This?

* Rhode Island reports a 95% success rate at making connections for its foster children via the program.
