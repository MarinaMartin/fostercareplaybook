### The Problem It Solves

The safety inspection often identifies minor items that need to be fixed before passing, such as repairing a window or purchasing a newer crib. These minor items need to be validated by the inspector, and require a return visit. 

### How To Do This

* Create an approved list of inspection items that can be resolved via photo (e.g. beds, smoke detectors, home repairs).
* Instruct families with only minor pending items to email a photograph when it’s resolved. Store this photo with the family’s file.
* If you’re modernizing your IT system to include a foster family portal, request the ability for the family to upload attachments, which could include these photos.

### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but suspect that this:

* Reduces the need for return visits
* Decreases the amount of time to completion
