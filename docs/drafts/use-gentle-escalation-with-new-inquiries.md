### The Problem It Solves

Not everyone is ready to become a foster parent right away. If becoming a licensed home is the only option they see, they may turn away. Providing smaller, lower-commitment ways to become familiar and involved can ultimately recruit these families.

### How To Do This

* Send new inquiries a list of ways to make a difference in the life of a foster child in addition to becoming a foster parent, such as attending an event, making a donation, volunteering to provide childcare at a foster parent event, mentoring, or becoming a CASA.

### Who's Doing This?

* Montgomery County, MD encourages families to start by participating in a diaper drive, then perhaps donating holiday gifts for foster youth, then perhaps hosting a coat drive, etc. This works particularly well at engaging community groups like churches.

* Colorado matches adult mentors with older foster youth through the [CHOICE Progra](https://www.raisethefuture.org/mentoring). 68% of participating youth find legal or relational permanency with their mentors through this program.

* Washington, DC signs up interested families for its newsletter, where they highlight opportunities to help foster youth.

* Frederick County, MD sends an email with 12 ways to help a foster youth, without being a foster parent, to interested families.
