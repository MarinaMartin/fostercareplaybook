### The Problem It Solves

Keeping track of a youth's connections can get complicated. Laying it out in an organized genogram can organize existing contacts and start surfacing additional possible connections.

### How To Do This

* Using a genogram tool (see below), or simply a blank piece of paper or dry-erase board, begin making a family tree of a child's connections. A genogram should include all important connections, even if they are not legal and/or blood relatives.
* Use the tree to generate new leads and to keep track of your contacts and progress.
* [The Extreme Family Finding Project](https://www.fosteradopt.org/family-permanency/extreme-family-finding/), which has a 95% success rate, recommends a genogram have at least 150-200 people on it.


### Who's Doing This?

* California 
* Indiana
* Michigan
* Rhode Island

### Real-World Examples

These tools are used and recommended by at least one of our child welfare system members, for mapping out and finding relatives of youth in foster care.
