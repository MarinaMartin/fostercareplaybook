### The Play

Use electronic calendars and text messages to share information about upcoming programming, and other materials, with youth, instead of sending physical copies in the mail.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone<br />
**Cost:**
Free (and you save on postage and printing)<br />
**Timeframe:**
Immediate<br />
**Difficulty:**
Easy<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Many foster youth do not have reliable physical addresses, making it difficult to receive physical mail. In a multi-state discovery sprint with older foster youth, [Think of Us](https://thinkof-us.org) found as many as 30% of mailed calendars returned to sender. This means as many as 30% of youth never learn about the programs being offered.

### How To Do This

* Email program calendars and other materials 
* Post your programming calendar online
* Use an online calendar that allows others to subscribe to your events (e.g. Eventbrite)
* Text a photo of the calendar or materials to youth

### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but believe that this:
* Eliminates return mail rates of up to 30%
