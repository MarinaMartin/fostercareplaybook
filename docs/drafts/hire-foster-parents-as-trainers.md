### The Play

**Who Can Do This?:**
Decision Maker<br />
**Cost:**
Upwards of $20 per hour<br />
**Timeframe:**
Months<br />
**Difficulty:**
Moderately hard to get the program started and funded<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Current foster parents who do not work for the Department can provide additional empathy and perspectives that can help new families decide to sign up, and/or decide to expand their horizons by expanding their training or placement preferences. This can also help retain the foster parents who are hired as trainers!

### How To Do This

* Work with HR to develop contracts for hiring and paying current foster parents.
* Set clear expectations about the role(s) for hired foster parents at trainings or with other responsibilities. They should complement, not replace, experienced trainers and staff.

### Who's Doing This?

* Frederick County, MD hires experienced foster parents to co-facilitate PRIDE foster parent training.
* Fairfax County, VA hires experience foster parents to conduct initial home visits for prospective foster families.
