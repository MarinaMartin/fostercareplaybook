### The Problem It Solves

Child welfare workers are busy! And so are families. Setting reminders is a simple way to make sure you stay in regular touch with potential foster families, and that they feel appreciated.

### How To Do This

* Create a separate calendar for reminders to check in with potential foster families.

* Use a task management app with date-based reminders to keep track of which families you need to check in with, when. Ideally, the entire team will share visibility across these lists in the app, so if someone is out sick someone else can cover their check-in calls (and, so the entire staff doesn't all call and overwhelm a family on the same day!)

* If your agency has a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, use it to keep track of inquiry follow-ups.

### Who's Doing This?

* Fairfax County, VA sets ticklers if families indicate they aren't ready to proceed due to a short-term issue like a move. The tickler reminds them to check back in after the event (e.g., move) is complete.

* Colorado keeps track of families who are interested, but not quite ready to foster yet, and staff checks back with them when there are free periods between busy workloads.

* Washington, DC has scheduled check-ins with every family on their inquiry list every quarter.

* Michigan uses electronic calendar reminders to keep track of checking in with potential foster families.

* Oklahoma checks back with families who submit inquiries within a week, 14 days, and then 30 days.
