### The Play

Call or meet with potential foster families when they submit an inquiry, instead of relying on automated emails and mailings. The human touch can help clarify expectations and get potential caregivers comfortable with moving to the next step. It can also help dissuade families for whom fostering is not a good fit (e.g., families only interested in adopting infants) early, so your agency can focus on families that meet the needs of your foster children.

### The Problem It Solves

Becoming a foster parent is a big step, and many potential foster parents need more human interaction to reassure them through the process. Also, when there's too much automation upfront, families for whom fostering is _not_ a good fit can get far into the process before they have any opportunity to talk with a real person.

### How To Do This

* Look for opportunities to include a human interaction, such as a phone call, early in the inquiry process. If you don't have the staff resources for this, consider [hiring current foster parents](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/hire-foster-parents-as-trainers) to help.

### Who's Doing This?

* In Fairfax County, VA, Dr. Cubillos provides her own phone number to families to register for orientation, instead of having an online signup form. This creates an opportunity for an early human conversation, where she can get to know the family, and they can ask early questions.
