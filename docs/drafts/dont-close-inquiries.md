### The Play

Keep all your potential foster family inquiries "open" - find ways to keep families engaged with newsletters, drip email campaigns, and the occasional personal check-in. You can also keep interested families engaged by highlighting other ways for them to help support foster youth, such as participating in a donation drive or volunteering at an event.

### The Problem It Solves

Just because a family is not ready to foster _today_ does not mean they couldn't be a strong placement option in the future. New data is showing that it can take some families years between they first take an interest in fostering and when they start an application. When systems delete or close out inquiries to meet short-term metrics like "conversion rates," they also potentially lose out on a number of families who would have signed up in the future.

### How To Do This

* If your team has performance metrics around converting inquiries to applications, stop. Turn your metrics into opportunities to encourage high-touch interactions with families, like phone calls or meetings, and ways to engage interested families in lower-level commitments like attending an event or participating in a donation drive.

* Identify ways to keep in touch with long-standing inquiries without taking up a lot of staff time, such as creating an automated email newsletter.

* Have clear policy about what steps a family has to retake, in what timeframe, if they begin part of the process but aren't ready to complete.


### Who's Doing This?

* In Frederick County, MD If a family has completed PRIDE and not submitted application packet within the next year, they have to do a PRIDE refresher. A lot take a long time - more take 6+ months than turn it in right away.

* Fairfax County, VA keeps all inquiries open, and reports that families can take an average of 2-3 years to move from an inquiry to an application.

* Washington, DC adds new inquiries to their newsletter and checks in with families quarterly. They do not close inquiries, and shares they sometimes have a family become licensed who has been on their inquiry list for as long as a decade!
