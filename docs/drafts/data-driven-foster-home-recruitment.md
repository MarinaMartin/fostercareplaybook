### The Problem It Solves

Foster children do best with families who can best meet their needs. When kinship caregivers aren't available, the next thing is a family that can keep them in their school, community, and culture.

### How To Do This

* Create a report you can run over time with the characteristics of children when they enter foster care. Include school attended, gender identity, race, ethnicity, age, religion, language spoken, and special needs. Work with your recruitment team to devise local strategies to attract matching families.
* Target more recruitment efforts in neighborhoods where there are higher removal rates, in order to help those children remain in their communities.
* Cross-reference incoming inquiries against your report, to prioritize matching families.
* Sign up for the working group's data-driven recruitment pilot (contact Marina).


### Who's Doing This?

* Hawaii regularly runs a report with data on each foster child that includes elements like their school of origin, age, whether they have a disability, and whether they are now placed in another school district. This report is the foundation of much of its recruitment work.
* Colorado has a data-driven digital recruitment plan that includes data on age, race, gender, and other identifying factors (IDD, large sibling group, sexualized behaviors). They also use GIS mapping to drive targeted recruitment efforts.
* Fairfax County, Virginia hosts recruitment booths at Farmers' Markets and other events in neighborhoods with high removal rates.
* Fairfax County, Virginia uses Census data to select which local libraries to host more recruitment events.
* Fairfax County, Virginia cross-references zip codes where they have the highest needs against zip codes listed on new foster home inquiry forms in order to prioritize those families.
