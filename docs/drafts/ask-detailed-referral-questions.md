### The Problem It Solves

When filling out a foster family inquiry form on a website, most people default to saying they heard about fostering "from the website" or "online" - but further questioning reveals they were really exposed through an event at their church, a family connection, a radio commercial, etc. If you don't understand all the ways you are attracting families, you may accidentally stop funding or using certain methods that are, in fact, successfully recruiting families.

### How To Do This

* Make sure you have "Other" on your inquiry form with a space to enter free text. Encourage detail by labeling this field "Other (please be specific)."

* Add a list of possible events, marketing materials, or other recruitment methods that someone may have been exposed to, to your inquiry form. Ask which one(s) the interested caregiver impacted the person completing the inquiry.

* Ask probing questions about how a family became interested in fostering in initial phone calls, and record this in a central location (e.g. shared spreadsheet) that can be tracked later.

### Who's Doing This?

* Frederick County, MD asks interested families to specify _in detail_ how they became interested in fostering, and asks them to indicate all the places where they heard about fostering on [their inquiry form](/assets/FrederickCountyInquiries.pdf). This helped them realize that ValPack mailers were actually reaching a lot of families.

* Fairfax County, VA does not ask for referral information on its inquiry form by design, and instead asks in their initial orientation phone call. They report this provides richer and more detailed answers than a form.
