### The Play

Leverage digital marketing campaigns alongside your other recruitment methods to recruit child-specific homes and/or more caregivers who can meet the needs of specific groups of children in care, such as CSEC or probation youth. Targeted digital recruitment can be more successful at finding these families than more generic campaigns.

### The Problem It Solves

We use online marketing to sell shoes and houses, but very few child welfare systems are taking advantage of this avenue for recruiting new foster homes. Unlike radio ads or billboards that must appeal to a wide audience, online ads can be highly customized to focus on caregivers who meet certain characteristics that your foster children need most, such as speaking Vietnamese or working in the medical profession.

### How To Do This

* Work with a digital marketing expert to design your first campaign. Working together, you can determine the kind(s) of caregivers you'd like to start recruiting; what collateral (e.g. email content, website landing page) you'll need to create; and what the right budget is. Online advertisements do cost money, but can have a higher return on investment than some analog recruitment methods.
