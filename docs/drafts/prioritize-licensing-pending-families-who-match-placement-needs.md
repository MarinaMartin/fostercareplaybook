### The Problem It Solves

Foster children often have to move schools and/or live with strangers who do not share their language and/or culture. Sometimes, a matching family is available for a child who otherwise does not have a strong match, but the placement desk cannot see that family because they have not yet completed the application process.

### How To Do This

* Include pending families in your placement searches. If there is a match, placement and licensing can work together to understand what steps must happen right away to license the family, versus which steps might be able to wait until after placement.

* In some jurisdictions, a judge can order a placement with a family that is not yet licensed, but who is otherwise a strong match for a child.

* If the child does not have to move right away, arrange visits or other interactions with the matching family as they complete the licensing process.

### Who's Doing This?

* Frederick County, MD pays close attention to new families in the application process relative to their children in need of placement or a better-fitting placement. When such a match occurs, they work with the family to prioritize their application process.

* Washington, DC proactively looks for strong matches between its children and new families. In some cases, they have arranged visits between children and potential families (with the involvement and approval of the child's case worker) to help develop a relationship until the family can complete licensure.
