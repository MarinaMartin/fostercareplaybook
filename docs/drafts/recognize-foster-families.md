### The Problem It Solves

Every system needs more ways to support and retain their best foster families.

### How To Do This

* Start a recognition program. Even a certificate and a perssonal note can go a long way towards making a foster family feel valued and appreciated (and all their friends will see the certificate on the wall).
* Commission local businesses to donate free or discounted items to help recognize families.


### Who's Doing This?

* Washington DC has "squads" of foster parents who support one another. Squads have monthly get-togethers and events, which can include recognition awards and modest prizes. The squads build camaraderie and help one another through challenges. Each year, there is a competition to see which squad recruits the most new families, with a ceremony and gift card prizes for the winning squad.
