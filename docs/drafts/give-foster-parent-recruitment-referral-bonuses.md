### The Problem It Solves

Financial bonuses to current foster families for referrals is another way to financially support current families while incentivizing successful recruitment activities.

### How To Do This

* Work with your legal and other teams to determine how you can provide financial stipends to families. In some cases, you may have an existing recruitment or retention contract that allows you make these payments already.

* Make sure to connect the bonus payments with milestones like completing licensure or accepting a placement.

* Make sure there is a clear way to track referral sources and milestones, so families are fairly recognized and compensated.

* If you cannot make cash bonus payments, consider if you can give other forms of prizes such as an award, a recognition event, gift cards, etc.

### Who's Doing This?

* Washington, DC challenges its "squads" of resource families to recruit more families. For each family that gets licensed, the referring family gets a $500 bonus. The squad that collectively recruits the most new licensed families gets a celebratory event with prizes and food. (In the pandemic, they delivered meals via DoorDash in lieu of in-person celebrations.)

* Montgomery County, MD provides current foster families with a $500 bonus if they refer other families. The first $250 is payable when the new family receives its license, and the second $250 is payable when they take their first placement.
