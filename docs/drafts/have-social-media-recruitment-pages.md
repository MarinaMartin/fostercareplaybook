### The Problem It Solves

Radio ads, billboards, television commercials, and other offline media help spread awareness of the need for more foster families, and a regular cadence of social media posts can raise awareness with even more community members.

### How To Do This

* Make a Facebook page for your department that includes a regular schedule of content. Include things like upcoming events, employee profiles, profiles of children available for adoption, FAQs, notices of upcoming orientations or trainings, and [ways for people to support foster youth without necessarily becoming a foster parent](https://www.childwelfareplaybook.com/drafts/use-gentle-escalation-with-new-inquiries.html).

* If you do not have a social media policy, you'll want to draft one that includes best practices like not "friending" other users, not sending sensitive information over private messages, and using official agency accounts instead of personal accounts. Your communications team may also want to participate in writing or vetting messages before they post.
