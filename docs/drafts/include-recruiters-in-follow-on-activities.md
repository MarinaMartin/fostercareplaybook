### The Play

Instead of passing off a family from a recruiter to a licensor, create more opportunities for warm hand-offs and for recruiting team members to still see and interact with their families.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone<br />
**Cost:**
Free<br />
**Timeframe:**
Immediate<br />
**Difficulty:**
Easy<br />

### The Problem It Solves

While separating duties can make your agency feel more efficient, being passed between staff members can be confusing and unpleasant for potential foster families, causing them to back out of the process. Warm hand-offs and opportunities to stay connected with staff members with whom they have developed relationships can help keep them engaged through to becoming licensed foster families.

### How To Do This

* Identify opportunities for recruitment team members to continue to interact with their families, whether through trainings, home visits, or communtiy events.

### Who's Doing This?

* Frederick County, MD has recruiters also conduct foster parent training, which means caregivers see a familiar face as they start the process.

* Fairfax County, VA has recruitment team members join a family's initial home visit for a warm hand-off to the licensor.
