### The Play

Set a required, short response time for following up with potential foster family inquiries. This makes you seem responsive and supportive to new families, can help weed out poor fits (e.g. families only looking to adopt infants) early on, and can get enthusiastic families signed up for training and starting their applications quickly.

### The Problem It Solves

Filling out a form indicating interest in becoming a foster parent is a big step. If too much time passes, a potential caregiver may become discouraged, second guess themselves, or change their mind.

### How To Do This

* Set a metric, ranging from one to seven days, for how quickly you will respond to new inquiries. This metric should be as short as possible, but realistic to achieve given your current staffing and resources.

* Track initial response times for new inquiries. If they begin to slip, work with the team to identify how to respond faster, such as increasing resources, using calendar reminders, etc.

### Who's Doing This?

* Ohio, a county-administered system, requires that all inquiries receive a response within seven days. They have developed a packet of materials to provide in response to new inquiries.
