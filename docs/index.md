Welcome to the Child Welfare Playbook, a collection of actionable best practices in child welfare from around the country. 

Everything in this playbook comes from our [growing community of child welfare practitioners](/about). It is a constant evolution--new tools, best practices, and resources for innovative approaches are added on a monthly basis. 

This playbook is designed specifically for you to copy these ideas. Our hope is that you will find something that could be useful to your team, and replicate it. 

(Seriously, you donâ€™t need to ask us--just take whatever you find useful!)
