### The Play

Use precise language to describe the day that foster care ends.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone, but it’s most effective if done across your entire program<br />
**Cost:**
Free, though you may have to re-print some materials<br />
**Timeframe:**
Within a few weeks<br />
**Difficulty:**
Easy<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Youth often misunderstand when their foster care ends by an entire year. In a multi-state discovery sprint with older foster youth, [Think of Us](https://www.thinkof-us.org) found that when youth hear foster care goes “until 21” they believe that means “until their **22nd** birthday,” but it means it ends on their 21st birthday. ” 

If a youth believes they have an entire extra year in care, they may accidentally delay plans and activities that can prepare them for independence.


### How To Do This

* Conduct an inventory of your program materials that reference the end of foster care (posters, pamphlets, website content, and hand-outs)
* Replace references to “until 21” with “to the end of 20” or “until your 21st birthday.” (If your program ends at a different age, follow this same pattern.)


### Outcomes Data

* Youth will clearly understand on what day they will age out of foster care.

Think of Us is conducting a study to identify the best language to use in this scenario, and we’ll update this play with their results.
