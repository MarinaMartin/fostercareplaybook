### The Problem It Solves

Families are often overwhelmed with responsibilities and let licensing renewal requirements like training and follow-on paperwork fall by the wayside. Mailed reminders are easily lost in the volume of other mailings received from a foster care agency. Most systems do not have an electronic portal for families to check their renewal status on their own, leaving them dependent on manual communications.

### How To Do This

* Write an email to a current foster family with an upcoming renewal, including every possible renewal requirement.
* Save this email as a template.
* Keep a list, in your IT system or in a spreadsheet, of currently-licensed families and their renewal dates.
* When a family is 60-90 days from their renewal date, send them this email, editing the requirement list to reflect their remaining steps.
* Respond as needed to continually mark requirements as complete, and highlight remaining steps


### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but believe that this means:
* Families can complete their renewal requirements faster, with fewer follow-ups from their licensing worker.
