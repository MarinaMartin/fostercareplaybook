### The Problem It Solves

Current CPR certification, training, pet vaccinations, and other requirements are generally required in order to renew a foster home license, but those renewal dates rarely line up with the actual foster home license renewal date. Sending reminders to families to address these items ensures that they are all caught up when itâ€™s time to renew their license.

### How To Do This

Add critical dates to your calendar:
* Add expiration dates to your calendar
* Turn on  a reminder notification 30-60 days ahead of time
* Suggest tracking these dates in your child welfare IT system, for inclusion in a future update.

Send a reminder to families in any of the following ways: 
 
* Shared calendar invite

* Mail (physical)

* Email 

* Text

_If possible, ask families what their preferred mode of communication is, and send the reminder that way._ 

### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but suspect that this:

* Increases timeliness of renewals
