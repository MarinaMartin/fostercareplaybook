### The Tools

These tools are used and recommended by at least one of our child welfare system members, for finding relatives of youth in foster care. These tools work best when coupled with a genogram.

**Accurint:** 
Records search from LexisNexis. [Link](https://www.accurint.com/)

**TLOxp (The Last One):**
Records search from TransUnion, one of the three credit bureaus. [Link](https://www.tlo.com/)

**Find a Grave:**
This tool can be helpful for completing genograms. [Link](https://www.findagrave.com/)

**Facebook:**
Additional family members can be found via public photos, posts, and friend lists, and contacted. [Link](https://www.facebook.com)
