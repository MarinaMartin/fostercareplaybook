### The Play

Leverage bilingual staff members wherever possible to deliver child welfare trainings. Use remote meeting technology to pair families and staff members who may live far apart.

### The Problem It Solves

Interpreters are highly skilled, but they don't have child welfare specific domain knowledge. This can make it tricky to translate important content (especially on the fly) during foster parent orientation and training (or in ongoing interactions).

### How To Do This

* Ask caregivers about the language with which they are most comfortable interacting as early as possible (on inquiry forms or at the very start of an application process). For kinship caregivers, child welfare workers should identify if they need an interpreter right away.
* Keep a list of bilingual staff members. Identify work flexibilities that can allow them to occasionally take on training responsibilities even if their normal responsibilities are in a different part of the agency.
* Leverage remote meeting capabilities to combine families and staff members who share the same language, even if they are in different parts of your state. 
* County-administered systems should pool resources.
