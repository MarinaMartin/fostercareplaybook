### The Play

Use mobile fingerprint scan units to capture and process fingerprints on-site in a family's home.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone<br />
**Cost:**
Estimated at $10,000<br />
**Timeframe:**
Within a month<br />
**Difficulty:**
Medium<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Families often need to make a separate trip to get fingerprinted. This increases time to approval, and requires more clerical work to coordinate appointments, etc.

### How To Do This

* Purchase a machine (often in the range of $10k+) 

* Comply with your state's requirements for using the machine, such as being trained by the Attorney General's office and having a dedicated printer for results

### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but believe that this:
* Decreases the amount of time to approval
* Decreases the amount of clerical work  
* Increases foster family applicant satisfaction

### Who's Doing This?
