### The Play

Directly deposit Extended Foster Care stipends into youth bank accounts.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Someone with accounting decision making ability<br />
**Cost:**
Should be achievable with your existing accounting system<br />
**Timeframe:**
2-3 months<br />
**Difficulty:**
Some setup time, easy to maintain<br />

### The Problem It Solves

In some places, youth in Extended Foster Care must travel to an in-person meeting each month to physically receive their EFC stipend.  This can be very burdensome for those in EFC as they are working or in college, and they may not have access to reliable transportation. During the pandemic, this left many youth without access to their stipends.

### How To Do This

* Open a bank account for each youth as part of your onboarding process
* Direct deposit stipends into this bank account

### Outcomes Data

* Youth will have access to their stipends more reliably
* Youth will have demonstrable income history on their bank statements
