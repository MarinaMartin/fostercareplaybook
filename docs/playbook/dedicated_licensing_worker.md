### The Play

Dedicate a single case worker to the entire licensing process from start to finish. This allows for high-touch engagement, and enables the case worker to get a more holistic and nuanced view of the family. It also increases family satisfaction, as they don't get confused by multiple workers. This only adds value if there are no more than 2-3 families per case worker.

### The Problem It Solves

Each part of the licensing process is often managed by different workers. This has several negative effects: 
1. it lengthens the process
1. it increases the likelihood of errors because more people are involved throughout, and 
1. it fractures the picture, leaving each worker with different pieces of information

### How To Do This

* Look across your existing team and look for opportunities to expand the scope of some or all workers' roles, in exchange for smaller case loads.
* Consider restructuring teams that have highly-specialized roles within the licensing process to more generalized roles. This requires careful planning and cross-training.
* Pilot this effort with one or two workers who are interested in being dedicated licensors. Survey families they work with, and families other team members work with, to learn if there is a meaningful difference in satisfaction, withdrawal rates, or licensing completion times.
* Clerical support is still valuable in a team with dedicated licensors, if it's available.


### Outcomes Data

A dedicated licensor increases foster family satisfaction, and may increase retention rates.
