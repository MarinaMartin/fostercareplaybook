### The Play

Align checklist items to specific statutes to help decision-makers understand the source of legal requirements.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone<br />
**Cost:**
Free<br />
**Timeframe:**
Weeks<br />
**Difficulty:**
Easy<br />

### The Problem It Solves

It ensures that decision-makers clearly understand the source of a problem, so they can identify the most effective solution. For example: a landline telephone requirement creates a challenge for many families, as [most](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/wireless201812.pdf) people are now in mobile-only households. Is it enough to change the requirement, or does the policy behind this requirement need to be updated / modernized? 

### How To Do This

* Create (or pull up) a list of all checklist items. 

* Identify the legal requirement for each item.

* Add the statute number next to each item on the checklist

Look at Washington’s [statute-aligned checklist](/assets/10-183 Foster Inspection Checklist.docx) as a starting point.

As time goes on, consider how you might “update” items that are proving challenging to families-- it enough to change the requirement, or does the policy need to be changed? 

### Outcomes Data

* Facilitates the modernization of outdated policies 
* Enables more effective decision-making
