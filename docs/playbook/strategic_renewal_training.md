### The Play

Offer a curriculum of the highest-value trainings, with childcare and meals taken care of, to make completing training hours prior to a renewal both simple for families and high-value for the agency.

### The Problem It Solves

Current foster families, overwhelmed with day to day responsibilities, often put off their training requirements until their renewal date is looming. In some systems, this means the only training available is reading books or watching movies, which does not maximally prepare caregivers for the needs of our children.

### How To Do This

* Secure a venue for an all-day training event on a recurring basis, at a time convenient for families (e.g. one weekend a month).
* Keep the pulse on most-requested and most-needed trainings by talking with other workers, listening to question at foster parent events, and surveying parents.
* Plan a training curriculum for the day around the highest-priority trainings for your community.
* Post the training online with clear instructions on how to sign-up.
* Notify families with license renewal dates within the next 4-6 months about upcoming training dates.
* Secure childcare.
* Make transportation (e.g. bus vouchers) easy to access.
* Provide lunch and snacks.


### Outcomes Data

Families that attend Resource Parent Education Conferences demonstrate greater skills and higher retention rates, while completing their renewal requirements on time.
