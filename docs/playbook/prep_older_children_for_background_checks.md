### The Play

Actively track when a 17-year-old household member of a foster family is going to turn 18 and initiate the background check process before his or her 18th birthday. (Adjust dates accordingly if your state requires checks for household members at a younger age, like 16.)

### The Problem It Solves

Members of foster families are required to undergo a background check as soon as they turn 18. It is often challenging for states and counties to complete the background check within the required timeframe after a child in the home turns 18 and becomes a legal adult, and this check is often late.

### How To Do This

* Note the birthdays of the children in the foster families whose cases you manage. This can be done using Excel, a calendar application like Outlook, or your IT system.
* Create a reminder 3-6 months before a member of the household turns 18, and prepare the necessary paperwork to initiate the background check process and share it with the family.
* Tell the family that the background check process must be initiated as soon as their household member turns 18. Ensure everyone understands what is required and how to submit the paperwork *before* the youth hits their milestone birtday.
* Before making a visit to a home, quickly check to see if anyone in the household has an impending 18th birthday, and prepare and bring the background check forms.

### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but we believe that this will: 
* Help to reduce the time it takes for background checks to be returned for household members who recently turned 18.
