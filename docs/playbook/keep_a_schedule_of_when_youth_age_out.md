**Difficulty:**

### The Problem It Solves

Staff often does not have an easy way to track which of their youth are nearing the date that they will age out, making it hard to plan and communicate effectively.  

### How To Do This

* Create a list, in Excel or in your case management system, for staff to easily view which youth are closest to aging out, so that their needs can be met before they exit care.
* Break the tracker down by: the next 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months.
* In Excel, you can enter the youthâ€™s transition date, and it can automatically sort into these categories.


### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but believe that this:
* Increases successful youth transition out of foster care.

### Who's Doing This?
