### The Play

Ask prospective foster families if they have lived out-of-state early in the application process. Provide Adam Walsh/out-of-state abuse/neglect check forms for the state(s) in which the family has lived during early meetings or information sessions with the family, to launch the out-of-state clearance process as soon as possible.

### The Problem It Solves

Out-of-state abuse & neglect registry checks checks vary substantially in how long they take. Some out-of-state clearances entail burdensome requirements, like notarized signatures or fees. Starting the out-of-state check process early helps to reduce delays and get foster families approved sooner.

### How To Do This

* Ask prospective foster families if they have lived out-of-state during or before your initial meeting with them. 
* Search for the correct Adam Walsh/out-of-state background check forms, either in your state or county Adam Walsh database or on state websites. 
* Print the forms and bring them to early information sessions or meetings with the prospective foster parents and make sure they understand how to fill out the form. 
* If notarization is required, try to secure a volunteer notary for the orientation to sign off on multiple forms at once.


### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but we believe that this will: 
* Reduce the length of the background check process for families that have lived out of state.
