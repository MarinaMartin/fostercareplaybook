### The Play

Put a sticker or draw a colored circle on important mail send to foster parents, so they know which envelopes are critical to open and which they can set aside.

### The Problem It Solves

Foster families report feeling inundated with mail -- policies, forms, announcements, new trainings, etc. This mail may stack up in a pile, risking that time-sensitive mailings go unopened.

### How To Do This

* Put a sticker or colored circle on crucial mail, like renewal letters.
* Communicate with families early on that they need to open and respond to "marked" mail
* Choose your "priority" mail wisely. If you put a sticker on every envelope, this play stops being effective.


### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but suspect that this will:

* Help families return renewal documentation more quickly.
