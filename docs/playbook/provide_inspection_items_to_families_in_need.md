### The Play

Provide critical safety items that families need to pass the safety inspection, but cannot--for any number of reasons--acquire. 

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone<br />
**Cost:**
Varies<br />
**Timeframe:**
Within a week<br />
**Difficulty:**
Medium<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Some families cannot--for reasons of time, money, or transportation--acquire key safety inspection items, like: rope ladders, oven locks, etc. This ensures that anyone who needs safety items can get them. 

### How To Do This

1/ Collect critical items

Find creative ways to acquire critical safety items that can be distributed to families in need. The most frequently needed items include: fire extinguishers, oven locks, baby gates, first aid kids, medication lock boxes, etc. 

* Host a “safety-inspection” drive. Similar to a backpack drive, this event would collect donated items (in new condition).
* Partner with local organizations. Work with local partners like churches to host drive/donation events, fundraisers, or anything else that can help collect needed items. 
* Use Family Preservation Service dollars to provide items for directed placements. FPS is an existing budgetary tool that can help acquire needed items when used for directed placement. 

2/ Distribute critical items

Make it as easy as possible for your team to distribute critical items to families in need. 

* Keep a stash of essentials in easy-to-access locations. This eliminates the need for a return visit. For example: the trunk of worker’s cars, designated supply closet.
* Provide key items at foster parent training. While families are present at orientation or early training classes, provide an opportunity to pick up any items they may be missing.


### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but suspect that this:

* Reduces the need for return visits
* Increases inspection passing rate for kinship homes
