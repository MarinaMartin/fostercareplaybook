### The Play

Form a dedicated family-finding team for your child welfare system, instead of relying on individual case workers to find kin for the children on their caseload.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Someone with decision-making authority<br />

**Timeframe:**
Months<br />
**Difficulty:**
Hard to start<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Effective family-finding can require a specialized skillset, from being savvy with social media to warm yet strategic communication with newfound kin in order to engage them in a child's life without scaring them. Not every case worker has all of these skills, and most have large workloads as-is. A small, dedicated team can focus on finding family and free up case workers for other tasks. A central team can also help standardize practices, and save money on subscription-based [family-finding tools](/family-finding-tools).

### How To Do This

* Create a new team or department. 
* Charge this new team with specific family-finding tasks, including:
  * using [family-finding tools](/family-finding-tools)
  * making initial contacts with potential kin
  * establishing initial [plans for staying in touch with kin](/plan-to-stay-in-touch-with-supportive-connections)
  * searching for more kin at regular intervals
  * prioritizing kin searches for children without kin placements
* Make hand-offs clear. Even with a dedicated team, finding kin is still everyone's responsibility -- there should be ways for other case workers, planning meeting attendees, and the youth themselves to contribute the names of more kin (or leads on how to find them).


### Outcomes Data

Member systems with dedicated family-finding teams report higher-than-average rates of kin placement.
