### The Problem It Solves

Many foster youth enter care with more connections than they leave with. If a supportive adult is not an immediate placement option, they are usually not tracked meaningfully by the system. Even if a contact does not play a permanency role for the youth, these contacts can play a significant role in the youth's development.  The Heart Map exercise provides a meaningful way for staff to surface these contacts with youth, in order to maintain and strengthen those relationships. 

### How To Do This

* Download a [Printable Heart Map](/assets/heartmap.pdf).
* Encourage the youth to list "someone in their heart" on each line, and draw more lines as needed.
* As soon as a youth enters care, walk them through a Heart Map to quickly surface the people who are important to them.
* Make an action plan to set up visits, phone calls, social media, and/or other continuing connections with each identified contact.
* Share the action plan with a youth’s entire team, including their foster parents, so everyone can help achieve it.

The two lines on the heart are strategic - more than one line prompts thinking about multiple relationships, but there are not too many, as not being able to fill in all the lines would be disheartening.

### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but believe that this:
* Increase the number and presence of  supportive adults in youth’s lives
