The Adam Walsh Act of 2006 requires that if a prospective foster parent lived in another state within the last five years, their current state must check the child abuse & neglect registry from their prior state(s) before licensing them as foster parents. All adults living in the home of a prospective foster parent must submit to this so-called “Adam Walsh check.”

Inconsistent processes across states for fulfilling these requests are putting children at risk, and cause some of the most significant delays in licensing foster parents. In jurisdictions that do not financially support relative placements until they are fully licensed, this delay translates into weeks or months of grandmothers struggling to make ends meet while caring for their grandchildren.

If every child welfare system followed the best practices below, it would eliminate most of these inefficiencies.

### Best Practices for Making Requests

* Ask whether applicants and the other adults in their household lived in other states in the last five years as early as possible in the process. If your application process includes a “mini” application or a “pre-application” form, ask there. The earlier you know, the earlier you can initiate the request, which can make delays less painful.

* Initiate out-of-state requests as early as possible in your process. Review licensing worker checklists and move this step towards the top of the list.

### Best Practices for Fulfilling Requests

* Eliminate requirements for anything more than the basic details needed to conduct the search. Request forms should not have to be filled out in particular colors of ink, be typed, be written in all capital letters, etc. 

* Respond to all requests. Without a response, the requestor does not know if the applicant passed the check, or if the request was lost.

* Do not charge a fee. It is so difficult for some states to issue a check to another state, even if only for a few dollars, that many licensing workers report paying these fees out of their own pockets. The vast majority of states do not currently charge any fees.

* Do not require a notarized signature. It is very difficult for a social worker to gather all household applicants together at one time to visit a notary. The vast majority of states do not require a notarized signature.

* Accept requests via email.

* Fulfill requests via secure email. This saves printing, postage, and time.

* Create a generic mailbox for receiving requests, instead of using an individual’s address. This prevents requests from being routed to former employees, where they will not be answered.

* Fulfill requests within 30 days.
