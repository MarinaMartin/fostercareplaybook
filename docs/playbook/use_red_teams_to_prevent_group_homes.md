### The Play

Create a Red Team, staffed by a diverse team of agency staff that are empowered to make decisions, to rapidly brainstorm and pursue alternatives to group home placements.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Senior Agency Leadership<br />
**Cost:**
Free<br />
**Timeframe:**
Months to get started<br />
**Difficulty:**
Moderately difficult to start<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Fewer youth will enter group homes if there is a team dedicated to finding alternatives.

### How To Do This

* Appoint a senior leader for the red team
* Appoint a diverse group of agency team members with reputations for problem solving
* Declare the goal of the red team is to find an alternative placement to group homes for every youth
* Require a red team meeting before any youth can be placed in a group home. You may add additional scenarios, such as placing a child out of state, or in a general foster home with other unrelated foster youth.
* Construct a genogram as part of the red team process.
* Ask the youth about their connnections and possible placement options as part of every red team.

### Outcomes Data

* Rhode Island has begun to depopulate group homes by requiring a red team before any group placement, or any placement into a home that already has at least one other unrelated foster child.

### Who's Doing This?

* Rhode Island

### Real-World Examples

* Rhode Island holds a red team meeting, led by the Chief of Staff of the Department, before a child is placed in a group home or in a general foster home where they would be with other unrelated foster youth. As part of the red team, the family finding office conducts kin research, the team constructs a genogram, and they ask the youth directly about possible placement ideas.
