### The Play

A dry-erase magnet for foster families to document practicing their fire and/or tornado evacuation plans.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone<br />
**Cost:**
Free<br />
**Timeframe:**
Immediate<br />
**Difficulty:**
Easy<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Many families forget to complete their required evacuation practice throughout the year, and don't have this information available at license renewal. The magnet reminds families to practice, and serves as easy documentation that they did so.

### How To Do This

Use this template ([DOCX](/assets/Emergency%20Fridge%20Decoration.docx) or [PDF](/assets/Emergency%20Fridge%20Decoration.pdf)) to print and laminate your own magnets, created by Clinton County MDHHS. If you modify this template, we'd love for you to share yours too!
