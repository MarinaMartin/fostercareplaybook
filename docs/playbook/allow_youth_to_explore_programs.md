### The Play

Make it possible for older youth to look through a list of available programming and choose topics most relevant to them, instead of requiring case workers to explain each program directly.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone with visibility across program offerings<br />
**Cost:**
Free<br />
**Timeframe:**
Immediate<br />
**Difficulty:**
Easy<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Many youth do not know what programs are available to them, and staff are managing so many cases, that they don't always have time to explain every available program. This means many youth miss out on opportunities to prepare for independence.

### How To Do This

* To begin, share a printed or emailed list of all programs with youth. Ask them to circle or highlight those that interest them.
* Then create a programming calendar online and allow youth to “RSVP” for programs of interest using a free tool like a Google Form, or Eventbrite.


### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but believe that this:
* Increases reliable data on what programs are of most interest to your youth--not just what people attend.


### Who's Doing This?

No one yet! But we heard the need from multiple members. Be the first?
