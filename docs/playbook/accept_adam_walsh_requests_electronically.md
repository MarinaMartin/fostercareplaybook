### The Play

Accept child abuse or neglect registry checks online, eliminating the need for applicants to mail in documents. This is particularly helpful during COVID-19.

**Who Can Do This?:**
Someone with decision making authority over background check policies<br />
**Cost:**
Free, possibly<br />
**Timeframe:**
Varies<br />
**Difficulty:**
Medium<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Applicants are required to submit documents for the registry check by mail. This leads to longer wait times, and various clerical errors. 

### How To Do This

* Accept out of state abuse and neglect registry check requests by email. If your agency has specific requirements like "use black ink," you may need to adjust these requirements first.
* Make electronic requests simpler by turning your current form into a fillable PDF, or a standard Microsoft Word document. Non-fillable PDFs must be printed and re-scanned, which is difficult for remote workers without a printer.
* Advocate for a requirement that your licensing system accept these requests electronically, if your system is embarking on an IT modernization effort.


### Outcomes Data

Eliminates lost mail and reduces processing time by at least a week.

### Who's Doing This?

13 states accept Adam Walsh requests electronically. 

### Real-World Examples
