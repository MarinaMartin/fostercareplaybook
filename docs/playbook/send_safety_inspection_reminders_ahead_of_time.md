### The Play

Make the safety inspection checklist available to families ahead of time. This gives the family time to proactively prepare for specific requirements that they may not have (like baby gates, oven locks, etc.). 

**Who Can Do This?:**
Anyone, but a licensing decision maker can make this standard practice<br />
**Cost:**
Free<br />
**Timeframe:**
Less than a week<br />
**Difficulty:**
Easy<br />

### The Problem It Solves

Some families do not pass the inspection on the first try because they are missing one or more things that they didn’t know they needed to have: a first aid kit, rope ladder, etc. This makes the certification process longer and uses more resources, as the inspector must go back a second time. 

### How To Do This

Make the checklist available in multiple places. The more, the better! This could include:
 
* Orientation (in orientation packet)

* Put it online with other application materials

* Include it in the appointment reminder (print it on the back, or include it as page two)

* Include it with a renewal reminder (print it on the back, or include it as page two). 

* Add it to your online licensing tracker application, if you have one


### Outcomes Data

We are still collecting concrete data, but suspect that this:

* Increases chances that the family will pass the safety inspection on the first visit
* Decreases chances that an inspector will need to go back for a second visit
* Saves time + resources that would be used for an inspector to go back for a second visit
