Multiple workgroup members have sent in a request to share or collaborate on materials related to COVID-19. Questions include:

- How can we move in-person recruitment online quickly?
- Is there online foster parent training that can be leveraged in the meantime?
- What are promising practices for home visits? Can some be done remotely or via video? Should workers ask screening questions (e.g. "have you been out of the country") prior to visits?
- What are the best ways to communicate with families with guidance about how to help keep kids healthy, when to go to the ER, etc?

If your area has information/resources to share - or if you would like to join an impromptu side-group to share resources - please message Marina! Feel free to share this message.

Alternately, if you know of an existing group that's sharing this information, please let us know - not looking to be duplicative.
