This page contains example text for the play [Resolve Minor Pending Items with Photos](/playbook/resolve_minor_pending_items_with_photos).

### Sample Emails


*The following sample email language can be adapted to instruct families with only minor pending safety inspection items to email a photograph of the fix when it is resolved, instead of requiring a return visit to the residence.*



Dear [family member name],

Thank you for welcoming me to your home on [home inspection date] for your home safety inspection. As we discussed during my visit, the following minor items must be resolved before we can move forward with the licensing process: 

[List minor pending items to be addressed]

Please take a clear photo of each item once it has been resolved and send the photos as attachments to [inspector email address]. If this step is completed accurately, we will have no need for a return visit. Thank you and please don’t hesitate to call [inspector phone number] if you have any questions. 

Regards, 
[inspector name] 

**Example:** 

Dear Ms. Jones,

Thank you for welcoming me to your home on May 8th for your home safety inspection. As we discussed during my visit, the following minor items must be resolved before we can move forward with the licensing process: 

* Repair cracked bedroom window
* A newer crib without drop-sides

Please take a clear photo of each item once it has been resolved and send the photos as attachments to hsmith@sample.gov. If this step is completed accurately, we will have no need for a return visit. Thank you and please don’t hesitate to call 888-303-2820 if you have any questions.

Regards,
