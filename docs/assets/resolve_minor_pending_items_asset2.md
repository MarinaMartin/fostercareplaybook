This page contains example text for the play [Resolve Minor Pending Items with Photos](/playbook/resolve_minor_pending_items_with_photos).

### Sample IT Requirements

*This is sample language describing this functionality in a way that can help you make a request to your IT team or contractor.*


We’d like to add new functionality to our system that will make it possible for our families to upload attachments to their licensing application, including image files. 

**GOAL:** To enable families to upload attachments, including image files, to our system.  

**REQUIREMENTS:** This functionality should… 
* Enable the user to upload a photo from any device
* Be easy to locate in the system
* Be easy to use in the system 
* Allow the user to easily delete an image 
* Enable the case worker to easily find, view, and download the image
* Connect to anything that is digitally tracking items required for completion / approval
* Be tested with actual families, in their local environments, on their own device(s)
* Be tested with actual case workers, in their local environments, on their own device(s)

Other needs that emerge through user testing should be incorporated in an iterative manner. 

**SUCCESS:** Successful implementation of this will be measured by whether or not: 
* An applicant can upload an image 
* An applicant can delete an image 
* A case worker can find an image
* A case worker can view an image
* A case worker can download an image

WHY: In order to simplify our process as much as possible, we want to allow our foster families to send pictures confirming resolution of minor pending items, instead of having to schedule--and wait for--another visit.

### Sample User Stories

*If you’re modernizing your IT system to include a foster family portal, request the ability for the family to upload attachments, which could include these photos.*



These are sample user stories that can help your IT team better understand the people who will be using this product / functionality. 

User stories are informal, plain-language descriptions of a feature of a product / system / experience that are written from the perspective of the “end-user.” In this case, that’s either (1) the applicant, or (2) the case worker. 

It often follows this pattern: 

As a [role], in order to [state outcome here], I can [state specific goal/action/desire].



**USER 1: Applicant**

As an applicant, in order to prove that I have resolved a minor pending item identified in my safety inspection, I can upload/attach images to my application. 

As an applicant, in order to correct / remove an image that should not be there, I can delete images from my application. 


**USER 2: Case Worker**

As a case worker, in order to confirm/validate that the applicant has resolved a minor pending item identified in the safety inspection, I can find and view the images submitted by the applicant.

As a case worker, in order to confirm/validate that the applicant has resolved a minor pending item identified in the safety inspection, I can download the images submitted by the applicant.
