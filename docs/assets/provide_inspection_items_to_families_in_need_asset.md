This page contains example text for the play [Provide Safety Inspection Items to Families in Need](/playbook/provide_inspection_items_to_families_in_need).

### Sample Language


*The following sample language can be used to publicize a safety-inspection drive that (similar to a backpack drive) allows community members to collect and donate critical safety items in new condition that can be distributed to resource families in need. Eligible items may include fire extinguishers, oven locks, baby gates, first aid kits, medication lock boxes, etc. Please adapt this language as needed to fit your circumstances and the format of the announcement (such as fliers, email blasts, social media, or Eventbrite).*


Join [Agency name] in supporting foster families! Before fostering, families are required to make their homes as safe as possible for children. You can help ensure that the cost of home safety equipment is not a barrier for supportive, loving homes for our stateâ€™s foster children, particularly for relative placements.

We are asking the community for donations of the following items. Please donate new items only. Unfortunately, we cannot accept used items. 

* Fire extinguishers
* Oven locks
* Baby gates
* First aid kits
* Medication lock boxes
* [List any other items that are needed here]

When:  From [start date of drive] to [end date of drive]

Thank you for supporting foster families in need!
